# End-to-End Functional Test

The `js` directory contains the in-development replacement for the Permanent Functional Test. It uses end-to-end testing via Cypress to test functionality rather than hitting the API directly.

Currently it exists in a subdirectory since the plan is to eventually completely replace the Python project in this repository, rather than make a new one.
